This is a very simple barebones example of how to build a bridge building game.

For now this requires the development versions of SDL and Box2D to be installed and in your path.

For Windows, create a Visual Studio project and add all the source files and link to sdl and box2d.

For Linux, simply type the following on the commandline:
g++ main.cpp -lSDL -lBox2D
